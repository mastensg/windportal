# Windmachine
An interactive installation demonstrating the power of the wind.

The machine simulates the wind conditions at the Hywind off-shore windmill part in Scotland.
Live data about current windspeed conditions are fetched, and the audience can trigger to experience this wind-power
by the press of a button.

Developed for Equinor in collaboration with ad-agency [Dept](http://dept.no).
